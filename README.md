add-institution

Application used for self-management identity providers. When SAML2 service provider requires attributes from the identity provider, this tool can be used for check if the identity provider provides all required attributes and if yes, then identity provider is automatically added to the whitelist. Whitelist is then processed by the simpleSAMLphp for rendering only checked identity providers on discovery service.
